WHAT IS NOSQL ??

-> Stands for "NOT ONLY SQL"

-> A Non-Relational database (No Tables)

-> A flexible database used for big data and real-time web apps.

-> Multiple types of databases.












WHAT IS BIG DATA ??

-> A term for data sets that are so large that traditional methods of storage and processing are inadequate.

-> Massive increase in data and volume within the last decade or so.

-> Social networks, search engines etc.

-> Challenges in storage, capture, analysis, transfer, etc.












ADVANTAGES OF NOSQL OVER RDBMS:

-> Handles Big Data.

-> Data Models - No predefined schema

-> Data Structure - NOSQL handles unstructured data

-> Cheaper to manage.

-> Scaling is a huge advantage for NoSQL databases - Scale out / Scale in.







SCALE OUT ->
        In a scale-out architecture, associated with NoSQL databases, a distributed set of nodes known as a cluster is used as the basic architecture. It provides highly elastic scaling capability, enabling you to add nodes to handle load on the fly.












ADVANTAGES OF RDBMS OVER NOSQL:

-> Better for relational data.

-> Normalization:
        Normalization organizes data in a way that eliminates redundancy so all the databases are stored in one place.
        .
-> Well known language (SQL).

-> Data Integrity.

-> ACID Compliance:
        Acronym for Atomicity Consistency Isolation and Durability. 














TYPES OF NOSQL DATABASES : 

-> Document Databases [MongoDB, CouchDB]

-> Column Databases [Apatche Cassandra]

-> Key-Value Stores [Redis, Couchbase Server]

-> Cache Systems [Redis, Memcache]

-> Graph Database [Neo4J]
